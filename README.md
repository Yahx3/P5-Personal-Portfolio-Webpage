2. [ ] The welcome section should have an `h1` element that contains te t
3. [ ] Your portfolio should have a projects section with an `id` of `projects`
4. [ ] The projects section should contain at least one element with a `class` of `project-tile` to hold a project
5. [ ] The projects section should contain at least one link to a project
6. [ ] Your portfolio should have a navbar with an id of `navbar`
7. [ ] The navbar should contain at least one link that you can click on to navigate to different sections of the page
8. [ ] Your portfolio should have a link with an id of `profile-link`, which opens your GitHub or freeCodeCamp profile in a new tab
9. [ ] Your portfolio should have at least one media query
10. [ ] The height of the welcome section should be equal to the height of the viewport
11. [ ] The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport

Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!

**Note:** Be sure to add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS.


# Future Improvements & Roapmap
The following are future tasks for improvement, to be taken on provided appropriate time. It is easy to be bogged down with a goal of perfection. In efforts to continue the progression of growth, I will leave these tasks untended and continue towards my next project. These are some of the critiques I would provide for improvement on this project.

**Design Improvements:**

*Navigation Bar*

1. Complete the CSS only design for the mobile drawer. Currently the overlay transition is not functioning to provide smooth animation. The positioning of the overlay is stuck atop the rest of the nav bar. 
2. The design does not function appropriately with flexbox.
3. The code has been intentionally left in the code. A final decision needs to be made, whether to use the code, or remove it.

*Welcome Section*

1. The *profile photo* and *name card* positioning in the mobile design should be relative to each other. This can be done by creating a container for the two items, and `position` them `absolute` so they can be anchored to the same parent, this the distances from `bottom` will be the same, creating a mirage of connectivity between the two pieces.
2. 

*Projects Section*

1. The past project details are currently placeholders. Detailing the project tiles is needed. Images need to be replaced.

*History Section*

1. The history tile details are currently placeholders. Detailing the history tiles is needed. Images need to be replaced.
2. Additional history tiles need to be added.
